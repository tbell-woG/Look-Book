# Project Description
Art and the visual element of our world not only allow us to connect to the world of our predecessors, but we can also meditate on the world in which they created their art. They reflect not only the highpoints of a given culture, as well as catastrophic, seemingly overwhelming odds that human beings have overcome. Pandemics are no exception to this. When people view a piece of art that they find to be beautiful, the brain releases dopamine, a chemical associated with feelings of love and happiness. The knowledge that other images can transform our understanding of crisis since they reflect past periods of turbulence, equips us to better understand and reflect on the highs and lows of our world today. 
<br>
<br>
Lookbook is an application designed around this idea. Through viewing art in a portable, digital space, the power of the art museum (now a closed environment because of COVID-19 restrictions) becomes readily available to everyone, everywhere, on any device. Since so many museums and cultural institutions have been forced to shut their doors temporarily, having them available in the form of a mobile app reveals the transformative potential of Lookbook as not just an alternative to scrolling social media, but a medium in itself to reflect on an image that a user finds striking, meditate on it, and record these thoughts.

<br>
 Using the Rijksmuseum (Amsterdam, Netherlands) API, Lookbook is able to display well over 650,000 pieces of art from their collection. On the homepage, the user is welcomed with the Lookbook logo, slogan, and an image of The Thinker sculpture by Augstine Rodin. They are also able to click several links in the navigation bar: "Home", "About", "Log In", "Sign Up", "Search", and "Favorites". Users are allowed to create an account using their email and password, which will allow them to login at anytime to view their collection. On the "Favorites" page, the user is allowed to view their collection of favorited art pieces that they have saved in their profile. There they can keep the piece in their favorites or delete them. On the "Search" page, the user is presented with an art piece and they can decide whether to like or dislike the piece. If they like the piece, it will be saved into their favorites collection. If they dislike a piece, a new art piece will appear for them to make a decision. The Lookbook app was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and several other dependencies. It also used Rijksmuseum API as its databse to display all of the art pieces.
